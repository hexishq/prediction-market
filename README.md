# Prediction Market - Open protocol.

The goal of this program is to anyone that wants to create a prediction market dApp be able to create it, without needing to create a program for it or having the knowledge for that. We take care about the business logic, you take care about making a beutiful frontend application and doing the marketing 😉. 

As of it right now the protocol is gaining 1.25% for each deposit, and the creator of a prediction will gain also 1.25%. The creator of a prediciton will be able to end, saying which side won.

## Some cool features:
- User will receive the same amount of a token of based on the amount of sol that he deposits, this is cool because people can create dexes and trade those tokens as well.
- Tokens are burned when claimed and anyone with tokens can claim the respective share that they have on the pool, so you can actually buy tokens from others and when the pool finishes you can claim. Enabling many options like arbitrage and trading the tokens.

More documentations and examples soon...
